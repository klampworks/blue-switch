blue-switch
===========

A utility for safeguarding systems remotely through Bluetooth.

At the moment this project is simply a collection of demo projects as I get familiar with the Bluetooth protocol and the Bluez API.

The long term goal of this project is to allow messages to be sent from one machine to another over Bluetooth in a secure way that cannot be spoofed. The original use case for this was an emergency kill switch.
